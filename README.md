# LIRI-bot
###Your first Node.js application. Week 10 project for the UT Coding Bootcamp.
This repository serves as an introduction to Node.js and running JavaScript in an environment other than the Browser. 
###Usage:
The LIRI-bot takes 4 commands: <br>
1. my-tweets <br>
2. spotify-this-song <br>
3. movie-this <br>
4.do-what-it-says <br>

First command will fetch my last 20 tweets. (can be configured to find another user's tweets.) <br>
Second command takes a song title as an argument and returns relevant info. <br>
Third command does the same thing as the song, but with a movie title <br>
Fourth command will do any of the above 3, but will read command input out of a text file named random.txt
